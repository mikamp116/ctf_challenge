You found the source code repository.

Your next task is to find the flag stored in the source_code.zip

Dexter is the owner of the repository and doesn't want anyone to see this code, so he has protected the zip with a password.

Dexter has very bad memory, so he keeps a file named "password.hash" to remember the password.

Humans still find it difficult to get passwords from hashes, so you may find additional files to assist you.

Happy hacking!
